\value{None value is returned. From a .Rnw noweb file, the corresponding
.txt is produced (as eventuals files for graphs).}
\note{In order to work properly, noweb codes have to be located at the
beginning of a line (no indentation).

Compare with RweaveLatex driver, RweaveTextile provides four new options :
\code{res} for the resolution of jpg or png figure (if produced),
\code{ext} (extension) for the format of figure that will be inserted,
and \code{png} and \code{jpg} (from \code{R2HTML} package) to produce png
and jpg figures.

In addition, \code{cache} option from \code{cacheSweave} or \code{weaver}
package is also available with \code{cacheSweaveTextile} driver and
\code{weaverTextile} driver.

A wrapper for \code{Sweave} can be used, named \code{Textile}.}
